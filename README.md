# ZetaBox
A universal switch board automation device to make a particular room IOT(intranet) enabled.

Generally we love to have switch board on our bed side to have all the controls within out reach, but this is not the scenerio always.
Hence I have made a box like device that uses arduino and bluetooth to create a intranet connection with the mobile app to control upto 3 
appliances/ swtiches such as tv/fridge/fan/light/AC etc

Also the code uses an ultrasonic sensor to keep measuring the water level of the water tank and switch the water pump on/off as per the need without the need on human intervention.
